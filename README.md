Description:
Physics tool for showing one implementation of the conservation of energy.

System is a ball with mass 'm' connected to an elastic string with spring
constant 'k'. This ball is moved in a vertical (perpindicular to the floor)
circle about a central point. This tool uses the conservation of mechanical
energy to predict the length of the elastic string given some angle theta.
